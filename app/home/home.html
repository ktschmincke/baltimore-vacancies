    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <p>
        This is an app I put together to explore data on vacant buildings in Baltimore, MD.
        It is built using AngularJS 1.x and Bootstrap and for displaying data it
        uses <a href="http://ui-grid.info/">UI Grid</a> and a library of
        Angular directives for <a href="http://www.chartjs.org/">Chart.js.</a>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Included in this app are two views: a Grid view for viewing the data in a tabular
        fashion and a Chart view for viewing a line chart depicting the number of vacancies
        per month for the past year.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Enjoy!</p>
