## Baltimore Vacancies
This is an app I put together to explore data on vacant buildings in Baltimore, MD.
It is built using AngularJS 1.x and Bootstrap and for displaying data it
uses [UI Grid](http://ui-grid.info/) and a library of
Angular directives for [Chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org/).


Included in this app are two views: a Grid view for viewing the data in a tabular fashion and a Chart view for viewing a line chart depicting the number of vacancies per month for the past year.

### Prerequisites
The only prerequisite needed is [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). Once node is installed the node package manager (npm) will be installed with it. Npm will install all remaining dependencies.

### Installing and running
Installing and running the app is simple. Just a single command will install all necessary dependencies, and run a simple http server which will serve the app:

`
npm start
`
Once the server has been started use your browser to navigate to `localhost:8000`
